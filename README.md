Is your Mac OS X device slow? Use this app to run a simple command to clear the RAM and the Disk Cashe on your device.

How it works:
Automator script to display dialogs and structure for the app.

Applescript to run a command - the sudo purge command. This is the part which requires an adminsistrator password
