# Cleanup.app
Is your Mac OS X device slow? Use this app to run a simple command to clear the RAM and the Disk Cashe on your device.
It requires an Administrator password.

<h2>How it works:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Automator script to display dialogs and structure for the app.</li>
  <li>Applescript to run a command - the sudo purge command. This is the part which requires an adminsistrator password</li>
</ul>
